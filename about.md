IT professional, all-around tech geek, gamer and music aficionado from Toronto, Canada. Father of one. I enjoy tinkering and figuring out how all things work at a fundamental level. One might say that I align to reductionist leanings but I try to keep an open mind as well about the world at large. Driving radical change within an organization is my passion. 

I've run the gambit of video gaming since 1995. Platformers, RPGs, FPS and pretty much everything in between. Current gaming:
* FromSoftware action RPGs (Bloodborne, DS3)
* Hollow Knight

Occasionally stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ambientmf).

## Music
My musical interests are widely varied but tend to be cyclical. I go through phases of a few albums or bands that are listened to on repeat. My major genres of interest as a listener are:
* electronica; IDM (most Warp Records artists), drum-and-bass, glitch, ambient, trip-hop and trance
* rock; alternative, indie, folk, instrumental & post-rock
* metal & punk. Metalcore, hardcore punk, post-hardcore, death metal, melodic death metal 
* orchestral music; romantic, impressionist & modern eras mostly
* video game & movie soundtracks

I'll publish some playlists of essential albums and genre lists in the future.

You can follow me on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/skfps8h9c0jkrvjiuaxrb2bkd?si=e5CNyUDcQcW7ugHH0tLFjw) where you'll find a bunch of random playlists & list of favourite albums depending on my mood. I need to organize it better for it to be useful. [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/ambientmf) has most of my historical charts of that's of interest as well. 

I have been playing acoustic guitar since about 2006. Am largely self-taught with no formal musical training. I also dabble in electronic music production.

IT professional, all-around tech geek, gamer and music aficionado from Toronto, Canada. Father of one. I enjoy tinkering and figuring out how all things work at a fundamental level. One might say that I align to reductionist leanings but I try to keep an open mind as well about the world at large. Driving radical change within an organization is my passion.

## Gaming
I've run the gambit of video gaming since 1995, pretty much my whole life. Platformers, action RPGs, FPS and pretty much everything in between. I love unique gaming experiences but also challenging gameplay. I game on PC and console (really, wherever the good games are).

My handle on most gaming platforms is `ambientmf`. Occasionally streaming on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ambientmf). You can find me on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/ambientmf) or PSN.

## Music
My musical interests are widely varied but tend to be cyclical. I go through phases of a few albums or bands that are listened to on repeat. My major genres of interest as a listener are:
* electronica; IDM (most Warp Records artists), drum-and-bass, glitch, ambient, trip-hop, trance
* rock; alternative, indie, folk, instrumental ("math rock") & post-rock
* metal & punk; metalcore, hardcore punk, post-hardcore, death metal, melodic death metal, grindcore, mathcore
* jazz and improvisional stuff
* orchestral music; romantic, impressionist & modern eras mostly
* video game & movie soundtracks

I'll publish some playlists of essential albums and genre lists in the future. It's something I like discussing but am by no means a music critic or expert; just a rabid fan.

You can follow me on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/skfps8h9c0jkrvjiuaxrb2bkd?si=e5CNyUDcQcW7ugHH0tLFjw) where you'll find a bunch of random playlists & list of favourite albums depending on my mood. I need to organize it better for it to be useful. [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/ambientmf) has most of my historical charts of that's of interest as well. 

I have been playing acoustic guitar since about 2006. Am largely self-taught with no formal musical training. I also dabble in electronic music production.
